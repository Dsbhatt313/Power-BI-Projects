# Power-BI-Projects
This repository contains three Power BI dashboards, each with the following files:

.pbix: This is the Power BI project file, which contains the interactive dashboard. Unfortunately, GitHub does not support direct viewing of .pbix files. To explore the dashboard, download the file and open it using Power BI Desktop.

.pdf: A static version of the dashboard is provided in .pdf format for easy viewing if you don't have Power BI Desktop installed. This allows you to see the layout and insights generated from the data.

.xlsx: The raw data used to create the dashboards. This file contains the data sets that were imported into Power BI and used for analysis and visualization.

Feel free to download and explore the files as needed!
